# myRepo
This is my public repository for my university tasks.

## Event-driven applications
The C++ applications were made in Qt Creator, and the C# applications were made in Visual Studio. I used Model-view and Model-view-viewmodel architecture patterns.

## Algorithm and data structures
I implemented Common factor polynomials with a list of touples.

## Computer graphics
I made two simple programs. In the first one I made simple U-shapes from 5 cubes, and the formation is moving on a specific parabole.
